<b>BENEDICK</b>
<blockquote>
Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?
</blockquote>

<b>BEATRICE</b>
<blockquote>
[Unmasking] I answer to that name. What is your will?
</blockquote>

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<blockquote>
Do not you love me?
</blockquote>

<b>BEATRICE</b>
<blockquote>
Why, no; no more than reason.
</blockquote>

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<blockquote>
Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio. Have been deceived; they swore you did.
</blockquote>

<b>BEATRICE</b>
<blockquote>
Do not you love me?
</blockquote>

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<blockquote>
Troth, no; no more than reason.
</blockquote>

<b>BEATRICE</b>
<blockquote>
Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula. Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.
</blockquote>

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<blockquote>
They swore that you were almost sick for me.
</blockquote>

<b>BEATRICE</b>
<blockquote>
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
</blockquote>

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<blockquote>
'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
</blockquote>

<b>BEATRICE</b>
<blockquote>
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
</blockquote>

<b>LEONATO</b>
<blockquote>
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
</blockquote>

<b>CLAUDIO</b>
<blockquote>
And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her; For here's a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashion'd to Beatrice.
</blockquote>

<b>HERO</b>
<blockquote>
And here's another. Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick.
</blockquote>

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<blockquote>
A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take thee for pity.
</blockquote>

<b>BEATRICE</b>
<blockquote>
I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.
</blockquote>

<b>BENEDICK</b>
<blockquote>
Peace! I will stop your mouth. [Kissing her]
</blockquote>
